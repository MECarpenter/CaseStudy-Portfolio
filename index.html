            <h2>Vanguard</h2>
            <h4>Interactive Design for Modern Storytelling</h4>

            <h3>Background & Context</h3>
            <p>
                The <strong>Vanguard</strong> project was created to explore how visual hierarchy,
                rhythm, and movement can guide user attention and enhance the storytelling aspect
                of digital design. The assignment challenged me to merge visual creativity with
                technical implementation using HTML, CSS, and animation principles. The purpose
                was to develop a functional yet engaging user experience while maintaining
                accessibility and clean layout organization.
            </p>

            <h3>Problem / Objective</h3>
            <p>
                The main objective of this project was to design a modern web interface that
                demonstrates my ability to implement dynamic motion while maintaining usability.
                The challenge involved using hierarchy and rhythm not only for aesthetics but to
                improve user comprehension and navigation. The end goal was to create a site that
                feels structured, balanced, and alive.
            </p>

            <h3>Process & Methodology</h3>
            <p>
                I began by researching effective motion-design systems and how rhythm influences
                attention on screen. I created wireframes and mapped key transitions before
                building the layout using semantic HTML5 and CSS Grid. CSS transitions and
                keyframes were integrated to establish movement consistency. Each interactive
                element was carefully timed and tested for responsiveness. The entire process
                included iterative testing for accessibility, ensuring color contrast compliance
                and smooth animation flow across browsers and devices.
            </p>

            <h3>Results & Outcome</h3>
            <p>
                The completed design achieved an elegant balance between movement and clarity.
                The page demonstrated that animation could enhance comprehension without
                distracting the viewer. Layout and typography followed a clean visual rhythm,
                leading users naturally through the content. The final version successfully
                validated as accessible, responsive, and visually cohesive.
            </p>

            <h3>Reflection</h3>
            <p>
                The <strong>Vanguard</strong> project taught me how to use animation deliberately
                to serve function. It strengthened my understanding of motion hierarchy and
                visual storytelling in user experience. Through experimentation, I learned that
                thoughtful movement can elevate design intent and emotional engagement when
                combined with clarity and simplicity. This project represents my growth as a
                designer who bridges technical coding skills with creative communication.

        <section id="fieldfeast" class="case">
            <h2>Field & Feast</h2>
            <h4>A Responsive Farm-to-Table Website</h4>

            <h3>Background</h3>
            <p>
                <strong>Field & Feast</strong> was a class assignment focused on building a
                responsive website using semantic HTML5 and CSS. The goal was to create a clean,
                elegant layout that reflected a farm-to-table brand identity. The professor provided
                the content, photos, and design mockups, and my task was to code a site that matched
                the example and displayed correctly across multiple screen sizes. This project helped
                me apply web standards while maintaining visual consistency and brand harmony.
            </p>

            <h3>Problem Statement</h3>
            <p>
                The main goal was to create a functional, responsive website that accurately followed
                the provided mockups. The design needed to use semantic HTML, organized CSS, and
                accessibility best practices—including descriptive alt text and responsive images
                adapted to different devices and browsers.
            </p>

            <h3>Process</h3>
            <p>
                I began by creating a new GitHub repository called <em>field and feast</em> and opened
                the project in Visual Studio Code. Using semantic HTML5 tags like
                <code>&lt;header&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;main&gt;</code>,
                <code>&lt;section&gt;</code>, and <code>&lt;footer&gt;</code>, I structured the content
                to create a logical flow that worked well for both users and assistive technologies.
            </p>
            <p>
                Next, I designed the layout with CSS Grid and media queries, applying a
                mobile-first approach so the site looked great on smaller screens before adjusting to
                tablets and desktops. I paid close attention to spacing, alignment, and text hierarchy
                to maintain readability. All images were made responsive, and I included descriptive
                alt text for accessibility.
            </p>
            <p>
                Once the structure and styling were complete, I validated the HTML and CSS with the
                W3C Validator, corrected warnings, and published the finished site using GitHub Pages.
                Even though I no longer have access to the original repository, I kept the mockups and
                screenshots that document the layout and responsiveness of the final build.
            </p>

            <h3>Results</h3>
            <p>
                The completed website presented a calm, refined aesthetic with smooth responsiveness
                across devices. Its balanced grid layout, clear typography, and organic color palette
                reflected the simplicity of a farm-to-table brand. Through this project, I strengthened
                my understanding of semantic structure, CSS Grid, accessibility, and publishing through
                GitHub Pages.

        <section id="wunderlust" class="case">
            <h2>Wunderlust Travel</h2>
            <h4>Accessible, Mobile-First Travel Website</h4>

            <h3>Background</h3>
            <p>
                <strong>Wunderlust Travel</strong> was created as a responsive web design
                project focused on accessibility, structure, and mobile-first principles.
                The goal was to design and code a travel-themed website that provided a
                smooth, enjoyable browsing experience for users planning their next trip.
                The assignment emphasized clear organization, responsive images, and
                semantic HTML structure that adapts to all screen sizes.
            </p>

            <h3>Problem Statement</h3>
            <p>
                The main challenge was to design and code a travel website that would
                validate successfully through the W3C standards, remain fully accessible to
                users with disabilities, and maintain readability across mobile, tablet,
                and desktop devices. The project required integrating responsive imagery,
                proper form structure, and consistent navigation while keeping the design
                visually appealing and engaging.
            </p>

            <h3>Process</h3>
            <p>
                I began by setting up the project using <strong>semantic HTML5</strong> to
                define a logical structure for accessibility tools. Tags such as
                <code>&lt;header&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;main&gt;</code>,
                <code>&lt;section&gt;</code>, and <code>&lt;footer&gt;</code> were used to
                provide meaningful context for each part of the site. I followed a
                <strong>mobile-first approach</strong>, ensuring layouts scaled smoothly as
                screen sizes increased.
            </p>
            <p>
                Using <strong>CSS Grid</strong> and <strong>Flexbox</strong>, I designed a
                balanced layout for different content sections — including travel
                destinations, accommodations, and testimonials. The site featured a
                contact form built for accessibility and form validation. I also used
                <code>&lt;picture&gt;</code> elements to deliver optimized images for
                various screen resolutions, improving both performance and usability.
            </p>
            <p>
                Throughout development, I validated my code, reviewed accessibility
                contrast, and tested responsiveness on multiple devices. Once finalized, I
                published the project through GitHub Pages and documented screenshots of
                the completed interface.
            </p>

            <h3>Results</h3>
            <p>
                The final website delivered a modern, inviting design that inspires travel
                exploration while maintaining accessibility standards. The structure was
                easy to navigate, images loaded efficiently across devices, and form inputs
                followed usability guidelines. The project successfully demonstrated
                technical knowledge of HTML semantics, responsive image handling, and
                accessible design principles.
            </p>

            <h3>Reflection</h3>
            <p>
                <strong>Wunderlust Travel</strong> strengthened my understanding of
                mobile-first design and inclusive accessibility practices. This project
                helped me learn how to balance aesthetics with functionality and
                performance. It reinforced that thoughtful coding and testing lead to
                user-friendly, professional results suited for real-world applications.

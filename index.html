            <h4>Interactive Design for Modern Storytelling</h4>

            <h3>Background</h3>
            <p>The Vanguard project demonstrates the importance of hierarchy, rhythm, and movement in modern web design. The goal of this assignment was to explore how these design principles guide the user’s attention while maintaining accessibility and structure. This project helped me develop a stronger understanding of layout balance and the use of motion to enhance user experience rather than distract from it.</p>

            <h3>Problem / Objective</h3>
            <p>The main objective was to create a web page that reflects professionalism and creativity while showcasing strong design and coding skills. The challenge was to effectively use hierarchy and animation to build a cohesive and visually engaging layout that remains user-friendly and accessible.</p>

            <h3>Process & Methodology</h3>
            <p>I started by sketching and planning the layout, focusing on how each section could flow naturally for the viewer. I used semantic HTML5 and CSS Grid to structure the page, ensuring that the design was both responsive and organized. CSS transitions and hover effects were applied to add movement and depth. I tested the site for accessibility and device responsiveness throughout development to maintain consistency and usability.</p>

            <h3>Results & Outcome</h3>
            <p>The final result was a modern and interactive web page that demonstrates mastery of layout structure, motion, and design rhythm. The page achieved visual harmony while maintaining accessibility standards, resulting in a professional and engaging experience for users.</p>

            <h3>Reflection</h3>
            <p>Vanguard reinforced my appreciation for the relationship between motion, hierarchy, and accessibility in web design.
